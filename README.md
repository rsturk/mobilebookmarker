#Mobile Book Marker

This project is a mobile webpage that allows the user to easily add bookmarks to [Delicious.com](http://www.Delicious.com).


Once you provide a URL this app loads the webpage's title and any tags that have already been used on Delicious.com for the URL.

###Getting Started:

Copy the project to a webserver that has PHP running. And you're ready to start bookmarking.

Go to the URL of the project and use your Delicious.com user name and password.

Paste a URL that you would like to bookmark, hit next and save.

![screen3](http://robertsturk.com/files/images/screen3.jpg "screen3")

###Things that I hope to add:
- Better authentication
- The ability to choose to bookmark to [Pinboard.in](http://pinboard.in), [Delicious.com](http://www.Delicious.com), or both
